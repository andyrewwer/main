# Absolute Beginner

Learning about Spring for the first time.

## Audience

You're on the hook to work on a "Spring Application" (whatever that means), and you want to understand the fundamentals.

## Objectives

- Be able to say you've written a Spring-based app.
- Know the difference between Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control.

## Do

1. Write a "Hello, World!" Spring application â€” http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/#quick-start
    - note this tutorial illustrates DI only.
    - the whole time, your application is in control of the flow of events.
1. Take "Hello, World!" to the web with Spring Boot: https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
    - note this tutorial includes IoC.
        - The line `SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);` starts the IoC container and runs until the app is stopped.
        - the code you write (namely the controller) plugs-into the container.  The IoC container _controls_ the routing of the request to your code.
1. Check out the Spring ecosystem: https://spring.io/projects and feel the ~~overwhelm~~ amazement from its sheer size.
