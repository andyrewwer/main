# Welcome to Spring Roots

## Study Guides

"Study Guides" are themed flows of material to study for a particular goal.

These are the remaining contents of this repository.

- [Absolute Beginner](absolute-beginner) -- the fastest way to get started with Spring if you've never used it before.

## Deep Dives

"Deep Dives" are in-depth guided practice sessions tuned for deep understanding.  These are meant to satisfy appetites for fluency with a particular Spring technology.

Each is a separate git repository with an extensive guide in the `README.md`.

- [Application Context Deep Dive](https://github.com/spring-roots/application-context-deep-dive) -- become fluent with the inner-workings of the heart of Spring applications: the Application Context.
  - start with the simplest possible Application Context, explore each component (like the `BeanFactory`, `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`, `MessageSource`, `Environment`, and others.
  - slowly include more feature-rich versions of the Application Context all the way to a fully-initialized Spring Boot-configured application.
- [Aspect-Oriented Programming Deep Dive](https://github.com/spring-roots/aop-deep-dive) -- become intimate with Aspect-Oriented Programming in the Spring ecosystem.
  - seed a sample "aspect" using the Decorator pattern and evolve it through proxies and ultimately AspectJ aspects.
  - understand in what circumstances to apply each of the AOP options.
